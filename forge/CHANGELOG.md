## [0.0.16-1.18.2] - 2022.12.30
### Changed
- Items that are unbreakable or cannot be damaged now bypass the `limitedByDurability` configuration
- Changed the localization of the activation keybinding from `Activate` to `Activate Vein Mining` for clarity of purpose

## [1.18.2-0.20] - 2022.09.01
### Changed
- `maxBlocksBase` and `maxBlocksPerLevel` now account for the origin block [#60](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/VeinMining/issues/60)

## [1.18.2-0.19] - 2022.07.28
### Added
- Added `activationStateWithoutEnchantment` configuration option, defaulted to `"KEYBINDING"`, which controls the
activation method if `maxBlocksBase` and `maxDistanceBase` values are greater than 0 (which would mean that the
enchantment is not required for vein mining functionality)
### Changed
- Now requires Forge 40.1.0 or above
- Changed vein mining logic to accommodate for custom harvest logic from modded tools
- As a side effect of the above change, vein mining now works in Creative as well
